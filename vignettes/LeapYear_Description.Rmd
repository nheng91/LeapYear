## LeapYear package

This Vignette offers a brief description of how to use the **LeapYear** package.    The **LeapYear** contains only one function: *leap_year()*.  The user must enter a year between 1804 and 2400 and *leap_year()* will notify the user of whether or not the entered year was or will be a leap year. Examples of package use are included in the following documentation.

## Correct Use


```{r}
leap_year(1992)
```

```{r}
leap_year(1993)
```

## Incorrect Use

The user must enter only a single year as the argument.  If multiple years are entered *leap_year()* will produce an error.

```{r}
leap_year(c(1994,1995))
```

The argument entered must also only contain 4 characters.

```{r}
leap_year(20050)
```

The argument entered must also be a number.

```{r}
leap_year("Hello")
```
